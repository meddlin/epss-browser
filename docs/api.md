# EPSS Browser - API

I started coding the API from a couple tutorials to get it working.

- Go, gin tutorial: [https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin](https://go.dev/doc/tutorial/web-service-gin)
- Making a REST call from Go: [https://tutorialedge.net/golang/consuming-restful-api-with-go/](https://tutorialedge.net/golang/consuming-restful-api-with-go/)
- List of sample EPSS API calls here: [https://www.first.org/epss/api](https://www.first.org/epss/api)
