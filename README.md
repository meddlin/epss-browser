# EPSS Browser

"The [EPSS (Exploit Prediction Scoring System) Model](https://www.first.org/epss/model) is an open, data-driven effort for estimating the likelihood (probability) that a software vulnerability will be exploited in the wild."

Traditionally, security teams spend a lot of time reporting and acting on CVSS scores for 
specific CVEs. Disclosing these vulnerabilities is important, and scoring their severity 
is an excellent metric some prioritization decisions. _However, **severity** alone isn't 
everything. The EPSS provides likely exploitability context for security personnel to make 
better decisions.
